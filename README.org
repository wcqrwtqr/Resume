* Overall Summary

- Currently holding the rule of business development manager for Almurabit company and responsible for marketing and promoting three new technologies in Iraq oil field market, these technologies are
  1) Down hole memory camera: This technology used to explore shooting images and videos in full HD so the client can make proper decisions for his well intervention and improve production
  2) Echo meter sensor: The technology is old and widely used for the wells that relay heavily on the level of the liquid to be maintained at a certain level and need to monitor any changes that might happen so the client make his decisions accordingly.
  3) BossPac vibration sensors: The new technology is used for monitoring the equipment vibration and body temperature by sticking the vibration sensor using magnet and it starts measure the vibration the equipment generates and read it in a nearby receiver, and based on the vibration profile over a period of time it can tell the condition of the equipment and if it needs maintenance or not.

** 2013 OMV Yemen SharePoint
OMV Yemen Once the IT announced the implementation of SharePoint in OMV made the request and created a SharePoint site and called it HabbanFieldSite and implemented all the web site design and information in it (https://2connect-at.omv.com/teams/habbanonline/SitePages/Welcome to OMV Yemen.aspx ), this site is only accessed by OMV employee’s and is being used by the teams in Block S2 Habban Field, Sanaa Office & Dubai Office. All these self-projects were acknowledged by OMV field Manager and Ops Managers in Dubai and I received a mail of appreciation.
** 2013 OilSERV Surface well testing page in SharePoint
In OilSERV Iraq, created a Surface well testing page in SharePoint and created a document library for all the equipment available in the location which each item is grouped by Type/Serial Number, which made all the equipment information available on line. Also enforced all the supervisors to sync their laptops with the SharePoint site so all personnel are updated with the new files and certification.

* Streamlit data visualizer [[https://mpfm-gauges-upload.herokuapp.com][web page link]]

This site handles the data used for the operation in OILSERV with several type of equipment such as MPFM from ROXAR, metrolog and spartek down hole gauges as well was a page for simulating the number of trucks to load oil from well site based on the time of loading.

The data can be uploaded to the website of Heruko and it will perform a number of tasks such as:

1. Data visualization
2. Data averaging and download to csv files
3. create a correlation plot (for MPFM only)
4. Graph any axis from the data interactively

Another added feature is to simulate the number of trucks needed to load oil from a well site or a loading station based on the time needed to fill a tanker vs the number of loading stations available.

This project uses the following libraries:

 1. Streamlit
 2. Pandas
 3. Numpy
 4. Plotly
 5. seaboarn
